### Summary of Lessons Learned

Here's a concise summary of the key lessons learned from the "Field Notes on Deploying Research Robots in Public Spaces" paper:

1. **Importance of Field Studies in HRI**  
   - Field studies offer insights that controlled lab environments cannot, especially in understanding public interaction dynamics.

2. **Challenges of Public Space Deployment**  
   - Navigating permissions, public safety, and logistical hurdles are significant aspects of deploying robots in urban settings.

3. **Hardware Robustness and Portability**  
   - Emphasizing the durability and mobility of hardware is crucial for the unpredictability of public environments.

4. **Software Reliability and Modularity**  
   - Software used in the field must be reliable and modular to facilitate easy troubleshooting and adjustments.

5. **User Interaction and Public Perception**  
   - Understanding and predicting public interactions with robots is complex and requires careful consideration of human behavior.

6. **Data Collection and Noise Management**  
   - Collecting and filtering data in noisy, uncontrolled environments present unique challenges, necessitating robust data handling methods.

7. **Safety and Emergency Protocols**  
   - Implementing comprehensive safety measures and emergency stop mechanisms is essential for public deployment.

8. **Media and Public Relations**  
   - Managing media coverage and public relations is a delicate aspect that can significantly impact the study.

9. **Ethical Considerations and Consent**  
   - Ensuring ethical practices, particularly in consent and data usage, is paramount in public space research.

10. **Collaboration and Open Sharing**  
    - Encouraging open sharing of information and collaboration within the robotics community enhances
